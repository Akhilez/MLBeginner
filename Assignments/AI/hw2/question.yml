  2: If a query cannot be answered directly from the knowledge base, rather than let that query fail, the
     program should generate an answer, such as “The query < fill in here the query> cannot be answered
     based on this knowledge base”.
  3: Please include the queries in your program, such that when it is loaded in FRIL it will actually generate
     the answers. Please turn in your program, along with a sample of runs attached to your program file as
     comments.
