TODO:
  - Better data:
    - Write a static-algo-player where the decisions are logically hardcoded.
    - Generate data with this algorithm.
    - Train the model with this "good" data.
    - Now our model should predict some good positions.
    - If the model still sucks, then there's a problem with the model's design.
  - 1 vs 1 training:
      - Make 2 smart players play 10 matches.
      - Store their successful data on top of old data, remove the oldest played 10 matches.
      - Train them with the data
      - Go to step 1.
  - Conv network:
      - Find patterns for best positions.
