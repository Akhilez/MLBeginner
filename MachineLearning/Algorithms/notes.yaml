Types of ML algorithms:
  - Supervised:
    - Linear Regression:
        Desc: |
          Predicts values for parameters.
          The goal is to find a and b in the equation by minimizing the squared error distance from the equation line.
        Equation: y = ax + b
        Types:
          - Simple: Single x (independent variable)
          - Multiple: Multiple independent variables
          - Polynomial
          - Curvilinear
    - Logistic Regression:
        Desc: Used to predict class labels - probability of an event occuring.
        equation: logit(p) = ln(p/(1-p)) = b0 + b1 X1 + b2 X2 + b3 X3 .... + bk Xk
        Types:
          - Linear Discriminant Analysis
    - Decision Tree:
        Desc: This is awesome. Based on the values of the parameters, it makes the splits in the decision tree.
        Techniques:
          - Gini
          - Information Gain
          - Chi-square
          - Entropy
    - SVM:
        Desc: For n parameters, there are n dimensions. Then we predict a line/plane/volume to separate the classes.
