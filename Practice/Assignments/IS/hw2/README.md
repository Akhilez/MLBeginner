#### Problem 1:
Run `knn_classification.py` to run the kNN classifier.
Run `neighbourhood_classification.py` to run the neighbourhood classifier.

##

#### Problem 2:
Run `perceptron_classification.py` to run the perceptron classifier.

##

#### Problem 3:
To run the third problem, you have to uncomment the method calls in the main method to run the desired performance analysis.

After uncommenting, run `performance_analysis.py` to run all the algorithms and obtain all the graphs.

The graphs would not show up like the first two problems, instead, the graphs would be saved under the `figures` directory.
